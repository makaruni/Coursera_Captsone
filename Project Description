1. Project Description:
     - The goal of this project will be to determine the best place to start a cocktail bar in the city of New York. 
       The decision will be made by looking at areas of New York that are densly populated with restaurants but do not appear to have a 
       proportional amount of bars. Once a decision has been made on an area, Publicy available New York data will be used to find the 
       nearest public transporation. Proximity to public transportation could increase the likelihood that a potential customer would
       spend more. Considering there are many subway lines in New York, selecting will come down to the following findings:
          - The proximity to an area of New York that has a high concentration of eateries/night life.
          - High(er) income area
          - Area of New York where the average age of the occupants tends to be in the mid-to-late twenties and thirties (assuming there
               is a strong correlation between age and level of alcohol consumption).


2. Data used in this project will come from the following sources:
    A. Foursquare API which will allow me to identify a handful of areas which are sparsely populated with bars while having a large cluster
        restaurants and eateries. (https://foursquare.com/developers/apps)
    B. Part of the location decision will come to proximity to public transporation and since we are using New York city in this project,
        data from New Yorks open data program will be used to identify the proper subway line to build the bar by.
