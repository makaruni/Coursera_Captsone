Project Description:
     - The goal of this project will be to determine the best place to start a cocktail bar in the city of Toronto. 
       The decision will be made by looking at areas of Toronto that are high income 
       are close to public transportation (proximity to such transportation could encourage potential customer to spend more),
       and have highly rated restaurants in the area.
