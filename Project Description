1. Project Description:
     - The goal of this project will be to help a potential renter post their property on AirBnb. To some degree, it will serve as a
     feasibility study to see if putting their property on the app is a worthwhile investment. Factors that will go in to deciding whether
     or not the renter should post their property will include: location of the property, type of rental (i.e. house/apartment, single room, etc.),
     minimum number of nights someone has to rent, and starting price of the rental. Ultimately, it is my belief that the location of the property
     matters more than the type of property it is, as you are more likely to find someone to rent in Brooklyn relative to Queens.


2. Data used in this project will come from the following source:
    A. AirBnb Kaggle dataset that has properties listed in the New York Area. The dataset includes information on neighbourhood groupings
    (i.e. Queens, Staten Island, Bronx), and neighbourhoods within those groups.
          i. The dataset includes comments on each of the properties, but that will likely be removed as it does not add any value to the analysis
               I intend to do.
    B. The dataset will be used to map out the different types of rooms in the New York area to identify which room type is most popular, which
    neighbourhood group is most popular, and regression analysis will be done to identify the increase in pricing, if any, that any of these variables
    cause.
